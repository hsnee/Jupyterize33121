    "VPython Tutorial Lab\n",
    "Collaborate in groups of 2 or 3 students on this tutorial. The software for this tutorial is already installed on the computers in your classroom. Feel free to ask questions as you work. There is nothing to turn in with this tutorial, but there are a few TA Checkpoints.\n",
    "Learning Goals:\n",
    "• Learn about rate of change and apply it.\n",
    "• Practice discussing physics ideas with your group members.\n",
    "• Learn about variables, conditional statements and loops.\n",
    "• Become more comfortable with interpreting code and output from a program.\n",
    "1. Rate of change\n",
    "Imagine that right now it's 80 degrees outside and someone tells you that the temperature is decreasing at a rate of 2 degrees/hour. What will the temperature be in half an hour? Well, the final temperature will be the initial temperature plus the change in temperature. So that is 80 degrees + (-2 degrees/hour) × (1/2 hour) = 80 degrees - 1 degree = 79 degrees. We needed a negative sign because the temperature is decreasing. In general:\n",
    "final = initial + rate × change in time\n",
    "This formula gives an exact result if the rate is constant. However, we know that temperature isn't always decreasing at a rate of 2 degrees/hour. Clearly the temperature increases during some parts of the day! In this case we must be careful to only use this formula when our change in time that is small enough that our rate during this time is approximately constant. Thus, this formula gives a good approximation when our change in time is small (even if the rate isn't constant).\n",
    "Rates of change show up all over the place in physics. For example, velocity is the rate of change of position, and acceleration is the rate of change of velocity. As long as the change in time is small:\n",
    "final position = initial position + velocity × change in time final velocity = initial velocity + acceleration × change in time\n",
    "But say you want to know the final position of an object a long time later, say 3 hours later. What would you do? Well, you could break the 3 hours into small pieces of time like 1 second and then do many calculations, updating the position and velocity each time. Since 3 hours has 10,800 seconds you would need to do 10,800 calculations. Ouch. You could use a larger time interval, maybe 100 seconds, but then your accuracy may decrease and 108 calculations is still a lot. Luckily, computers are very good at doing many (boring) calculations quickly so they are ideal for this job.\n",
    "Some advantages of a computational approach:\n",
    "1\n",
    " • Many calculations quickly\n",
    "• Can easily modify code and re-run for a similar new problem\n",
    "• Can find approximate solutions to problems that can't be solved by hand\n",
    "One thing that you must remember is that the program will do whatever you tell it to do even if it gives you a result that is completely wrong! For example, if you make a program where the Earth orbits the Sun but make the time step between updates too large then Earth might crash into the Sun or fly off into outer space. Often there is a tradeoff between speed and accuracy, and you should always be mindful of the limitations of your program.\n",
    "In the rest of this lab you will create a program that uses the concept of rate of change to make a ball bounce.\n",
    "2. First program\n",
    "\n",
    "Type the following code into the blank window:\n",
    "  \n",
    "print (\"Hello World! This is our program.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "On the Run menu choose \"Run Module.\" Congratulations, you just ran a program! You should now have two windows. The code window is where you typed your code. The output window (titled Python Shell) gives text output from your program. Did the output window show your message?\n",
    "3. Variables and comments\n",
    "Now let's make things a little more interesting. Add to your program so it looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "print (\"Hello World! This is our program.\")\n",
    "from visual import *          # this makes the graphics work\n",
    "ball = sphere(pos=(0,50,0), radius=5, color=color.cyan)\n",
    "ground = box(pos=(0,0,0), size=(70,1,50), color=color.green)\n",
    "print (\"ground's position is\", ground.pos)\n",
    "print (\"ball's height is\", ball.pos.y)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Run your program again. A third window should pop up titled VPython. This is the display window. It gives visual output from your program. Do you see the ball and the ground? You can rotate the view by right-clicking and dragging on the display. You can zoom by holding down the right and left mouse buttons. Try it!\n",
    "Now take a look at your code again. Your program tells the computer what to do and when to do it, starting at the first line and working down to the last line.\n",
    "2\n",
    "\n",
    "Comments: Any text with # in front of it is a comment. Comments don't affect how the program runs. We add comments to make the code easier to understand.\n",
    "Object and attributes: The sphere and box created in your program are objects. ball is a sphere object and ground is a box object. Properties like pos, radius, size, and color are the attributes of the object. Try changing some of the attributes and re-run the program to see what happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables: Variables are names that we give to objects or numbers so that we can easily refer to them later. A variable is assigned to an object by the equals sign. In your program, ball and ground are variable names.\n",
    "You don't have to assign an object a name, but you must if you want to refer to it later or change its attributes. If you wanted to change the position and radius of ball later in the program you could add the lines:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ball.pos = (1,2,3)\n",
    "ball.radius = 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Checkpoint 1: At this point have a TA check your program. Explain to the TA why the code gives you the visual and text output that it does.\n",
    "TA check:___________\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Loops\n",
    "Now lets try to make the ball move. To do this we will need to update the ball's position many times so we can see movement. This calls for a loop! Loops are commands that tell your computer to repeat a segment of code as long as a certain condition is satisfied. Change your code so it looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "print (\"Hello World! This is our program.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "from visual import *          # this makes the graphics work\n",
    "\n",
    "ball = sphere(pos=(0,50,0), radius=5, color=color.cyan)\n",
    "\n",
    "ball.velocity = vector(0,-10,0)\n",
    "\n",
    "ground = box(pos=(0,0,0), size=(70,1,50), color=color.green)\n",
    "\n",
    "print (\"ground's position is\", ground.pos)\n",
    "\n",
    "print (\"ball's height is\", ball.pos.y)\n",
    "t=0\n",
    "dt = 0.01\n",
    "##### here's the loop\n",
    "while t < 30:\n",
    "    rate(400) # this controls how fast the loop executes \n",
    "    ball.pos = ball.pos + ball.velocity*dt # update position \n",
    "    t=t+dt #updatetime\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3\n",
    " We introduced three new variables:\n",
    "• ball.velocity is the ball's velocity. Remember that velocity is the rate of change of position. We set the\n",
    "ball’s initial velocity to be downward at 10 m/s. • t is the time elapsed; it starts at zero.\n",
    "• dt is the time step.\n",
    "Now look at the loop. It says to the computer \"while t is less than 30s, keep doing this code.\" The code that is inside the loop must be indented. Two important things are happening inside the loop. The position is updated, and the time is updated. (What would happen if we forgot to update the time?) Find the line that updates the position and compare it with the formula in Part 1 of this tutorial. What do you expect your program will do when you run it?\n",
    "Run your program. Does it do what you expected? Try adding a line to the loop so it prints out the ball's position each time and run your program again.\n",
    "Checkpoint 2: At this point have a TA check your program. Explain to the TA why the code gives you the visual and text output that it does.\n",
    "TA check:___________\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Adding acceleration\n",
    "Now we have the ball moving, but our program is missing gravity and our ball goes straight through the ground! Let's deal with the issue of gravity first. So far we have only updated the ball's position leaving its velocity constant. To incorporate acceleration due to gravity all we need to do is add a line that will update the ball's velocity. Remember that acceleration is the rate of change of velocity. Change your code so it looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "print (\"Hello World! This is our program.\")\n",
    "from visual import *          # this makes the graphics work\n",
    "ball = sphere(pos=(0,50,0), radius=5, color=color.cyan)\n",
    "ball.velocity = vector(0,-10,0)\n",
    "ground = box(pos=(0,0,0), size=(70,1,50), color=color.green)\n",
    "print (\"ground's position is\", ground.pos) print (\"ball's height is\", ball.pos.y)\n",
    "g = 9.8\n",
    "a = vector(0,-g,0)\n",
    "t=0\n",
    "dt = 0.01\n",
    "##### here's the loop\n",
    "while t < 30:\n",
    "    rate(400) # this controls how fast the loop executes \n",
    "    ball.pos = ball.pos + ball.velocity*dt # update position \n",
    "    ball.velocity = ball.velocity + a*dt # update velocity \n",
    "    t=t+dt #updatetime\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "4\n",
    " That's it! What do the added lines do? Find the line that updates the velocity and compare it to the formula in Part 1 of this lab.\n",
    "Run your program. Does it do what you expected? Try adding a line to the loop so it prints out the ball's velocity each time and run your program again. Can you make the ball’s acceleration be to the right rather than downward?\n",
    "6. Conditional statements\n",
    "Now let's make the ball bounce, rather than going straight through the ground. Your program tells the computer what to do and when to do it, starting at the first line and working down to the last line. However, you may only want the computer to do a part of your code if a certain condition is satisfied. In our case, we only want the ball to bounce if it hits the ground. This calls for a conditional statement! A conditional statement is a command that tells the computer to only do a segment of code if a certain condition is satisfied. Change your code so it looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "      print (\"Hello World! This is our program.\")\n",
    "      from visual import *          # this makes the graphics work\n",
    "      ball = sphere(pos=(0,50,0), radius=5, color=color.cyan)\n",
    "      ball.velocity = vector(0,-10,0)\n",
    "      ground = box(pos=(0,0,0), size=(70,1,50), color=color.green)\n",
    "      print (\"ground's position is\", ground.pos)\n",
    "      print (\"ball's height is\", ball.pos.y)\n",
    "      g = 9.8\n",
    "      a = vector(0,-g,0)\n",
    "t=0\n",
    "dt = 0.01\n",
    "      # here's the loop\n",
    "      while t < 30:\n",
    "rate(400) # this controls how fast the loop executes ball.pos = ball.pos + ball.velocity*dt # update position ball.velocity = ball.velocity + a*dt # update velocity t=t+dt #updatetime\n",
    "            if ball.pos.y < 0:\n",
    "                  print (\"Ball bounces at t =\", t, \"s\")\n",
    "                  ball.velocity.y = -ball.velocity.y   # make the ball bounce\n",
    "                  \n",
    "                  \n",
    "If the ball's y position goes below zero we know the ball has hit the floor. We have decided to model the bounce by changing the direction of the ball's velocity in the y direction. What do you expect your program will do when you run it?\n",
    "Run your program. Does it do what you expected?\n",
    "5\n",
    " Checkpoint 3: At this point have a TA check your program. Explain to the TA why the code gives you the visual and text output that it does.\n",
    "TA check:___________\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Optional Challenges\n",
    "1. Change dt to 0.5 and the rate to 40 (so it's easier to see the animation) and re-run the program. What do you see in the animation that is unphysical? What went wrong?\n",
    "2. Play with the ball’s initial velocity. What happens if the ball starts out going upward? To the right or left?\n",
    "3. Try modifying your code to make the ball have an inelastic collision with the floor. This means that the ball won't bounce back up with 100% of its impact velocity.\n",
    "4. Try making the color of the ball or the ground change each time the ball bounces. Some possible colors are red, green, blue, yellow, magenta, cyan, black, and white.\n",
    "5. Try adding left and right “walls” that the ball can bounce off of.\n",
    "6. Try giving the ball a weird acceleration that depends on time or on the ball’s height off the ground.\n",
    "(Because the acceleration changes you will need to put that line inside the loop!)\n",
    "If you would like to use your own computer for future labs (or just for fun) you can download VPython for free from http://vpython.org/. You need to download and install both Python and VPython for everything to work."
